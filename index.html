 <p>The Subaru WRX is an all-wheel drive sport compact car produced by Subaru. It is based on the Impreza, which was designed for the World Rally Championship in 1992. Subaru claims the WRX actually stands for "World Rally eXperimental." The WRX lineup has been separated from the Impreza lineup since 2014, with a different body style that is not available as an optional hatchback/wagon.</p>
 <h3>Engine Specs</h3>
 <p>The WRX STI retais the previous generation STI's EJ engine (2.0-litre EJ207 for Japanese models, 2.5-litre EJ257 for international models), as well as dual AVCS. It does, however, have ECU modifications that have increased fuel economy and provided a slight power boost. The EJ257 engine continues to be quoted at 305 hp (227 kW), but with 290 lbft (393 Nm) of torque, a slight decrease from the previous generation, but this is thought to be due to ECU reprogramming to support a stronger top end, and true power output is estimated to be around 235-240 kW. The EJ207 has a power output of 300 hp (224 kW) and a torque output of 311 lbft (422 Nm).The WRX STI also retains the previous generation's 6-speed TY85 manual transmission (the CVT is not available on the STI).</p>
 <h3>Transmission</h3>
 <p>The WRX now comes standard with a 6-speed TY75 manual transmission, up from 5-speeds. It is also available with a Lineartronic TR690 CVT with 6 or 8 simulated "gears" accessible via steering-wheel paddle shifters. The CVT is the only transmission option for the Japanese-spec WRX S4.</p>

 <p>The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X is the tenth and final generation of the Lancer Evolution, a sports sedan manufactured by Mitsubishi Motors in Japan.</p>
 <h3>Engine Specs</h3>
 <p>The Lancer Evolution X sedan is powered by a GEMA 4B11T 2.0L (1998cc) turbocharged inline-4 engine. Power and torque vary by market, but all models have at least 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp). (JDM version), with slightly more in the American market version. Mitsubishi UK redesigned the UK models to match previous MR Evolutions with the FQ badge. The UK Evolutions have 300 hp (220 kW) and 360 hp options (270 kW). The Lancer Evolution X sedan is powered by a GEMA 4B11T 2.0L (1998cc) turbocharged inline-4 engine. Power and torque vary by market, but all models have at least 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp). (JDM version), with slightly more in the American market version. Mitsubishi reworked the UK models.</p>
 <h3>Transmission</h3>
 <p>In the United States, there are two versions of the car available. The Lancer Evolution MR is equipped with a 6-speed Twin Clutch Sportronic Shift Transmission (TC-SST). The GSR, on the other hand, has a 5-speed manual transmission system. The vehicle also features a new full-time four-wheel drive system called S-AWC (Super All Wheel Control), which is an improved version of Mitsubishi's AWC system used in previous generations. [4] Torque vectoring technology is used by the S-AWC to send different amounts of torque to the rear wheels.</p>
 <p>It also featured Mitsubishi's new six-speed SST dual-clutch automatic transmission with shift paddles mounted on the steering wheel. Because it replaced the Tiptronic automatic transmission, the SST model replaced the GT-A model (which was used in Evolution VII and Evolution IX Wagon). Another option was a five-speed manual transmission option. Mitsubishi's next-generation RISE safety body was also included in the Lancer Evolution.</p>

 <p>The Subaru BRZ is a coupe manufactured by Subaru in collaboration with Toyota, which manufactures its GT86 technical twin at the Subaru plant in Gunma, Japan. It is the result of two concept cars: the BRZ Prologue, which debuted at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2011, and the BRZ STi Concept, which debuted at the Los Angeles Motor Show in November 2011.</p>
 <h3>Engine Specs</h3>
 <p>The BRZ breaks with Subaru's tradition of four-wheel drive and innovates propulsion. Its engine architecture however remains typically Subaru with its atmospheric 2.0 4-cylinder flat developing 200 hp and 205 N m. The low centre of gravity allows a very good weight distribution for this coupe: 53% at the front and 47% at the rear.</p>
